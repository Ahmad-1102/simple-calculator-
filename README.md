Key Features Explained
Persistent Storage
Calculations are automatically saved to localStorage, so your work persists even after closing the browser.
Dynamic Font Sizing
The display automatically adjusts font size when calculations get long (>15 characters) for better readability.
Error Handling
Invalid calculations show an "Error" message for 1 second before resetting.
Backspace Function
Easily fix mistakes without clearing the entire calculation.
Future Improvements
